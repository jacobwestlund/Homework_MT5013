# Allsvenskan

The first task is to Scrape a table of the teams of Allsvenskan from "http://www.elitefootball.com/league?leagueId=1" structured like ```teams``` on the course website.

```{r}
# Scrape teams
url <- "http://www.elitefootball.com/league?leagueId=1"
p <- read_html(url) %>% html_nodes(".table-condensed a") 

```

The next task is then to write a function to scrape players from the team page at "elitefootball.com".


```{r}
scrape_players <- function(team){
  url <- paste0("http://www.elitefootball.com", team)
  response <- GET(url)
  if (response$status_code != 200) {
    stop("The url is not valid")
  } 
  else {
    content(response) %>%
      html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
      .[[which(map_lgl(., function(df) names(df)[1] == "P"))]]%>%
      select(-"") 
  }
}
```

```{r}
scrape_players("/team/afc-eskilstuna/6185") %>% head()
```

```{r}
map(teams, scrape_players(.$link))
```
